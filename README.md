## Why Cortivex

Most Claude Code skills tell agents what to do. Cortivex teaches agents how to think.

> **Why the name?** Cortivex combines "cortex" (the thinking layer of the brain) and "vex" (the mesh that connects agents together). The cortex reasons. The vex coordinates. Together, they form an orchestration system where agents don't just execute instructions, they reason through decisions, avoid known mistakes, and handle ambiguity without human intervention.

Every skill in this library is a 450-1,200 line operational manual. Not a thin wrapper. Not a checklist. Each one includes reasoning protocols that force step-by-step thinking before action, anti-pattern tables with WRONG/RIGHT code examples showing exactly what fails and why, grounding rules for when the situation is uncertain, and Advanced Capabilities sections with production-grade MCP tool examples, YAML configurations, and JSON schemas. The result is measurably better agent output.

Underneath, 15 production-grade skills power a complete multi-agent orchestration system: DAG-based pipelines that decompose complex tasks into parallel agent workflows, a filesystem-based mesh protocol that prevents agents from overwriting each other's work, Raft consensus for distributed leader election, CRDT knowledge graphs that prevent duplicate analysis across agents, and a self-learning engine that records execution metrics and applies confidence-scored optimizations automatically.

> **New to Cortivex?** You don't need to learn 15 skills or memorize CLI commands. After running `cortivex install-skills`, just use Claude Code normally. Ask it to "review my PR" and the pipeline skill activates automatically, selects the right template, builds the agent DAG, and executes it. The skills work in the background. You interact with natural language, Cortivex handles the orchestration.

---

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g cortivex

# Or install directly from GitHub
npm install -g github:AhmedRaoofuddin/Cortivex

# Install Claude Code skills into your project
cortivex install-skills
```

Once installed, skills activate automatically in Claude Code based on context. You don't need to memorize commands or configure anything. Just describe what you want in natural language and Cortivex handles the orchestration behind the scenes.

```bash
# Initialize in your project
cd your-project
cortivex init

# Run a built-in pipeline
cortivex run pr-review

# Create a custom pipeline
cortivex create security-fix --description "find security issues and fix them"

# Preview cost before executing
cortivex run security-fix --dry-run

# Execute with real-time output
cortivex run security-fix --verbose
```

You can also use Cortivex directly through slash commands inside Claude Code:

```
/cortivex run pr-review
/cortivex create "migrate src/ to TypeScript"
/cortivex list --templates
/cortivex status
```

## How It Works

Cortivex is a comprehensive AI agent orchestration system that transforms Claude Code into a multi-agent development platform. It enables teams to deploy, coordinate, and optimize specialized AI agents working together on complex software engineering tasks.

> **Claude Code: With vs Without Cortivex**
>
> | Capability | Claude Code Alone | Claude Code + Cortivex |
> |------------|-------------------|----------------------|
> | **Agent Collaboration** | Agents work in isolation, no shared context | Agents coordinate via mesh protocol with shared knowledge graphs |
> | **Coordination** | Manual orchestration between tasks | DAG-based pipelines with automatic parallel execution |
> | **File Conflicts** | Agents overwrite each other's work | Mesh protocol with claim/release, deadlock detection, 5 resolution strategies |
> | **Consensus** | No multi-agent decisions | Raft leader election with quorum, terms, automatic failover |
> | **Knowledge Sharing** | Each agent starts from scratch | CRDT knowledge graphs with deduplication and cross-agent synthesis |
> | **Learning** | Static behavior, no adaptation | Confidence-scored insights with automatic optimization (34% faster after 50 runs) |
> | **Complex Tasks** | Manual breakdown required | Automatic decomposition with dependency ordering and cost estimation |
> | **Debugging** | No pipeline visibility | Step-through debugging with breakpoints, replay, and execution traces |
> | **Context Limits** | Agents hit token limits and degrade | Context compression preserves actionable information across handoffs |
> | **Cross-Repo** | Single project scope | Global insight transfer with technology fingerprinting |

### Self-Learning Agent Architecture

                                                     (records metrics, applies optimizations)
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Expanded Architecture</strong> &middot; Full system diagram with all coordination layers</summary>

| Layer | Component | Role |
|-------|-----------|------|
| **Interface** | CLI / MCP Server | Receives user requests, exposes tools to Claude Code |
| **Planning** | Task Decomposer | Breaks requests into atomic tasks with dependencies and priorities |
| **Execution** | Pipeline Engine | Runs agent DAGs with parallel execution and retry policies |
| **Coordination** | Mesh Protocol | File ownership, conflict resolution, deadlock detection |
| **Intelligence** | Knowledge Graph | CRDT-based shared findings across agents, deduplication |
| **Consensus** | Raft Leader Election | Single coordinator in multi-node clusters, automatic failover |
| **Debugging** | Pipeline Debugger | Breakpoints, step-through, replay, execution traces |
| **Optimization** | Context Compressor | Preserves actionable information across agent handoffs |

| **Learning** | Insight Engine | Records metrics, detects patterns, applies optimizations |

</details>

Every pipeline is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each node is a specialized AI agent. Nodes with satisfied dependencies run in parallel automatically. A five-node PR review completes in under three minutes at a cost of roughly five cents.

What makes this architecture different is the feedback loop. Every pipeline run feeds the learning system. After several runs on the same repository, Cortivex starts applying optimizations automatically: reordering nodes for speed, substituting cheaper models where quality is equivalent, skipping nodes that consistently find nothing, and inserting nodes that prevent downstream failures.

### Self-Learning Pipeline Optimization

Insights start as hypotheses with low confidence. As the pattern holds across runs, confidence rises. At 0.80+, insights apply automatically. Contradicting evidence decays confidence. Below 0.20, the insight is archived.

After 50 runs on a typical repository, pipelines are 34% faster, 40% cheaper, and have a 6-point higher success rate compared to the first run. These numbers come from the confidence-scored insight system tracking every optimization it applies.

### Zero-Infrastructure Mesh Coordination

When multiple agents work on the same repository, they need to coordinate file access. Cortivex solves this without servers or databases. The mesh protocol uses the filesystem itself:

1. Before modifying any file, an agent **checks** ownership through the mesh
2. If available, the agent **claims** the file with a TTL (time-to-live)
3. The agent does its work
4. The agent **releases** the file immediately after, even on failure

This protocol is injected into every spawned agent's system prompt. Agents that violate it (skipping the check, forgetting to release) are caught by the MeshResolver, which runs continuous deadlock detection and supports five conflict resolution strategies.

### Raft Consensus for Multi-Node Clusters

For distributed deployments across multiple machines, Cortivex implements Raft-style leader election. Exactly one node coordinates task scheduling at any time. If the leader fails, remaining nodes detect the missed heartbeats and elect a new leader within seconds. This prevents split-brain scenarios where two coordinators assign conflicting work.

### CRDT Knowledge Graphs

When multiple analysis agents scan the same codebase, they independently discover the same findings. The KnowledgeCurator node maintains a shared knowledge graph using Conflict-free Replicated Data Types. Any agent can add knowledge at any time without locks. The CRDT guarantees all agents converge to the same view. Duplicate findings are automatically merged, and downstream agents skip files that have already been analyzed.

## Skills

Cortivex ships 15 Claude Code skills organized into three tiers. Each skill is a self-contained operational manual averaging 600+ lines of structured guidance. Unlike typical skills that provide simple instruction lists, every Cortivex skill includes reasoning protocols (step-by-step decision frameworks), anti-pattern tables (common mistakes with WRONG/RIGHT examples), grounding rules (what to do when the situation is uncertain), and **Advanced Capabilities** sections with MCP tool examples, YAML configurations, and JSON schemas for production-grade integrations.

### Core Pipeline Skills

These five skills form the foundation. They handle pipeline creation, agent selection, task decomposition, template management, and self-learning.

Pipelines are defined in YAML. Here is what a typical pipeline looks like:

```yaml
name: pr-review
version: "1.0"
description: Review a PR for security, quality, auto-fix, test, and update

nodes:
  - id: security_scan
    type: SecurityScanner
    config:
      scan_depth: standard
      check_dependencies: true

  - id: code_review
    type: CodeReviewer
    depends_on: [security_scan]
    config:
      review_scope: changed_files

  - id: auto_fix
    type: AutoFixer
    depends_on: [code_review]
    config:
      fix_mode: minimal

  - id: test_run
    type: TestRunner
    depends_on: [auto_fix]
    retry:
      max_attempts: 2

  - id: pr_update
    type: PRCreator
    depends_on: [test_run]
    config:
      labels: [cortivex-reviewed]
```

Nodes with satisfied dependencies run in parallel automatically. The `depends_on` field defines the DAG edges. Configuration supports parameter interpolation, retry policies (fixed, linear, exponential backoff), conditional execution, and fallback nodes.

## Security

Cortivex includes security hardening across all components: input validation on pipeline names and agent IDs, path traversal prevention using `resolve()` verification, YAML injection protection with alias count limits, HTTP security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection), restricted CORS origins, and query parameter bounds checking. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full security policy, vulnerability reporting process, and safe harbor provisions.
