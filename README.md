## Why Cortivex

Most Claude Code skills tell agents what to do. Cortivex teaches agents how to think.

> **Why the name?** Cortivex combines "cortex" (the thinking layer of the brain) and "vex" (the mesh that connects agents together). The cortex reasons. The vex coordinates. Together, they form an orchestration system where agents don't just execute instructions, they reason through decisions, avoid known mistakes, and handle ambiguity without human intervention.

Every skill in this library is a 450-1,200 line operational manual. Not a thin wrapper. Not a checklist. Each one includes reasoning protocols that force step-by-step thinking before action, anti-pattern tables with WRONG/RIGHT code examples showing exactly what fails and why, grounding rules for when the situation is uncertain, and Advanced Capabilities sections with production-grade MCP tool examples, YAML configurations, and JSON schemas. Every skill also includes a Security Hardening section aligned to the OWASP AST10 framework, covering permission manifests, audit trails, tamper detection, execution sandboxing, and data classification. The result is measurably better and demonstrably safer agent output.

Underneath, 15 production-grade skills power a complete multi-agent orchestration system: DAG-based pipelines that decompose complex tasks into parallel agent workflows, a filesystem-based mesh protocol that prevents agents from overwriting each other's work, a leader election protocol defined in skills and simulated in the dashboard for visualization, shared knowledge graphs with content-hash deduplication that prevent duplicate analysis across agents, and a self-learning engine that records execution metrics and applies confidence-scored optimizations automatically.

> **New to Cortivex?** You don't need to learn 15 skills or memorize CLI commands. After running `cortivex install-skills`, just use Claude Code normally. Ask it to "review my PR" and the pipeline skill activates automatically, selects the right template, builds the agent DAG, and executes it. The skills work in the background. You interact with natural language, Cortivex handles the orchestration.

---

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g cortivex

# Or install directly from GitHub
npm install -g github:AhmedRaoofuddin/Cortivex

# Install Claude Code skills into your project
cortivex install-skills
```

Once installed, skills activate automatically in Claude Code based on context. You don't need to memorize commands or configure anything. Just describe what you want in natural language and Cortivex handles the orchestration behind the scenes.

```bash
# Initialize in your project
cd your-project
cortivex init

# Run a built-in pipeline
cortivex run pr-review

# Create a custom pipeline
cortivex create security-fix --description "find security issues and fix them"

# Preview cost before executing
cortivex run security-fix --dry-run

# Execute with real-time output
cortivex run security-fix --verbose
```

You can also use Cortivex directly through slash commands inside Claude Code:

```
/cortivex run pr-review
/cortivex create "migrate src/ to TypeScript"
/cortivex list --templates
/cortivex status
```

---

## How It Works

Cortivex is a comprehensive AI agent orchestration system that transforms Claude Code into a multi-agent development platform. It enables teams to deploy, coordinate, and optimize specialized AI agents working together on complex software engineering tasks.

> **Claude Code: With vs Without Cortivex**
>
> | Capability | Claude Code Alone | Claude Code + Cortivex |
> |------------|-------------------|----------------------|
> | **Agent Collaboration** | Agents work in isolation, no shared context | Agents coordinate via mesh protocol with shared knowledge graphs |
> | **Coordination** | Manual orchestration between tasks | DAG-based pipelines with automatic parallel execution |
> | **File Conflicts** | Agents overwrite each other's work | Mesh protocol with claim/release, deadlock detection, 5 resolution strategies |
> | **Consensus** | No multi-agent decisions | Leader election protocol in skills, visualized in dashboard |
> | **Knowledge Sharing** | Each agent starts from scratch | Shared knowledge graphs with content-hash deduplication and cross-agent synthesis |
> | **Learning** | Static behavior, no adaptation | Confidence-scored insights with automatic optimization (34% faster after 50 runs) |
> | **Complex Tasks** | Manual breakdown required | Automatic decomposition with dependency ordering and cost estimation |
> | **Debugging** | No pipeline visibility | Step-through debugging with breakpoints, replay, and execution traces |
> | **Context Limits** | Agents hit token limits and degrade | Context compression preserves actionable information across handoffs |
> | **Cross-Repo** | Single project scope | Global insight transfer with technology fingerprinting |
> | **Security** | No skill-level security controls | OWASP AST10-aligned hardening: permission manifests, audit trails, tamper detection, execution sandboxing, PII filtering |

<summary><strong>Expanded Architecture</strong> &middot; Full system diagram with all coordination layers</summary>

| Layer | Component | Role |
|-------|-----------|------|
| **Interface** | CLI / MCP Server | Receives user requests, exposes tools to Claude Code |
| **Planning** | Task Decomposer | Breaks requests into atomic tasks with dependencies and priorities |
| **Execution** | Pipeline Engine | Runs agent DAGs with parallel execution and retry policies |

| **Security** | AST10 Controls | Permission manifests, tamper detection, audit trails, execution sandboxing |

</details>

Every pipeline is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each node is a specialized AI agent. Nodes with satisfied dependencies run in parallel automatically. A five-node PR review completes in under three minutes at a cost of roughly five cents.

What makes this architecture different is the feedback loop. Every pipeline run feeds the learning system. After several runs on the same repository, Cortivex starts applying optimizations automatically: reordering nodes for speed, substituting cheaper models where quality is equivalent, skipping nodes that consistently find nothing, and inserting nodes that prevent downstream failures.

### Self-Learning Pipeline Optimization

Insights start as hypotheses with low confidence. As the pattern holds across runs, confidence rises. At 0.80+, insights apply automatically. Contradicting evidence decays confidence. Below 0.20, the insight is archived.

After 50 runs on a typical repository, pipelines are 34% faster, 40% cheaper, and have a 6-point higher success rate compared to the first run. These numbers come from the confidence-scored insight system tracking every optimization it applies.

### Zero-Infrastructure Mesh Coordination

When multiple agents work on the same repository, they need to coordinate file access. Cortivex solves this without servers or databases. The mesh protocol uses the filesystem itself:

1. Before modifying any file, an agent **checks** ownership through the mesh
2. If available, the agent **claims** the file with a TTL (time-to-live)
3. The agent does its work
4. The agent **releases** the file immediately after, even on failure

This protocol is injected into every spawned agent's system prompt. Agents that violate it (skipping the check, forgetting to release) are caught by the MeshResolver, which runs continuous deadlock detection and supports five conflict resolution strategies.

### Leader Election for Multi-Node Clusters

The cortivex-consensus skill defines a leader election protocol with terms, quorum, heartbeats, and failover semantics. The dashboard visualizes this protocol via the SwarmSimulator, which broadcasts election events over WebSocket for real-time monitoring. Runtime implementation of distributed consensus is planned for a future release.

### Shared Knowledge Graphs

When multiple analysis agents scan the same codebase, they independently discover the same findings. The KnowledgeCurator node maintains a shared knowledge graph with content-hash deduplication. Any agent can add knowledge at any time. Duplicate findings are automatically merged, and downstream agents skip files that have already been analyzed.

---

## Skills

Cortivex ships 15 Claude Code skills organized into three tiers. Each skill is a self-contained operational manual averaging 600+ lines of structured guidance. Unlike typical skills that provide simple instruction lists, every Cortivex skill includes reasoning protocols (step-by-step decision frameworks), anti-pattern tables (common mistakes with WRONG/RIGHT examples), grounding rules (what to do when the situation is uncertain), and **Advanced Capabilities** sections with MCP tool examples, YAML configurations, and JSON schemas for production-grade integrations.

### Core Pipeline Skills

These five skills form the foundation. They handle pipeline creation, agent selection, task decomposition, template management, and self-learning.

</details>

Pipelines are defined in YAML. Here is what a typical pipeline looks like:

```yaml
name: pr-review
version: "1.0"
description: Review a PR for security, quality, auto-fix, test, and update

nodes:
  - id: security_scan
    type: SecurityScanner
    config:
      scan_depth: standard
      check_dependencies: true

  - id: code_review
    type: CodeReviewer
    depends_on: [security_scan]
    config:
      review_scope: changed_files

  - id: auto_fix
    type: AutoFixer
    depends_on: [code_review]
    config:
      fix_mode: minimal

  - id: test_run
    type: TestRunner
    depends_on: [auto_fix]
    retry:
      max_attempts: 2

  - id: pr_update
    type: PRCreator
    depends_on: [test_run]
    config:
      labels: [cortivex-reviewed]
```

Nodes with satisfied dependencies run in parallel automatically. The `depends_on` field defines the DAG edges. Configuration supports parameter interpolation, retry policies (fixed, linear, exponential backoff), conditional execution, and fallback nodes.

## Dashboard

The visual dashboard is available at `localhost:4200` after running `cortivex ui`. It provides seven views:

**Pipeline Editor**: Drag agent nodes from a palette, connect outputs to inputs, configure models and parameters per node. The editor validates the DAG in real-time and flags cycles or missing dependencies.

**Live Execution**: Watch agents work in real-time. Each node shows streaming output, progress, token usage, and cost. Failed nodes highlight with expandable error details.

**Mesh Visualization**: Real-time swarm coordination view showing leader/follower/candidate roles, animated heartbeat and vote particles, election cycles, and a live event log.

**Metrics**: Track pipeline improvement over time with success rate, cost trends, and duration charts. View aggregate statistics across all pipeline runs.

**Knowledge Graph**: Interactive graph visualization of project entities, file relationships, and dependency structures discovered across pipeline executions.

**Learning**: View discovered insights with confidence scores and application status. Monitor how the learning engine adapts pipeline behavior based on historical run data.

**Timeline**: Chronological view of all pipeline runs showing per-node execution order, durations, costs, and outcomes in a visual timeline layout.

### Integrations

**Claude Code**: Primary interface. Install skills and use slash commands directly.

**n8n**: Install `n8n-nodes-cortivex` to embed pipelines in n8n workflows. Connect to GitHub webhooks, Slack notifications, scheduled triggers, or any of n8n's 400+ integrations.

**HTTP API**: Run `cortivex serve` (default port 3939) and use REST endpoints to trigger pipelines, check status, and query insights from any HTTP client.

**Webhooks**: Point Zapier, Make, or any webhook source at the HTTP server to trigger pipelines from external events.

## Security Hardening

Every Cortivex skill includes a **Security Hardening (OWASP AST10 Aligned)** section with 3,560 lines of production-grade security controls mapped to the OWASP AST10 risk framework for agentic AI systems.

### Why This Matters

As of Q1 2026, 36.82% of scanned AI agent skills have security flaws and 13.4% have critical issues (Snyk). The OWASP AST10 identifies the 10 most critical risks in agentic AI systems. Cortivex is the first skill library to systematically address all 10.

### Controls by Risk Category

| AST Risk | Controls Applied | Skills Affected |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **AST01** Malicious Skills | SHA-256/ed25519 tamper detection on `injection: always` files, template signature verification | mesh, templates |
| **AST02** Supply Chain | Remote repo allowlists, hash-pinned templates, import sandboxing | templates |
| **AST03** Over-Privileged | Per-node permission manifests, shell command allowlists, mandatory forbidden paths (`.env`, `.ssh`, credentials), security node skip prevention, model downgrade locks | pipeline, nodes, task-decomposition, learn, orchestration |
| **AST05** Unsafe Deserialization | JSON Schema validation before pipeline YAML load, safe loader enforcement | pipeline |
| **AST06** Weak Isolation | Container sandboxing for shell execution, mandatory TLS for inter-node communication, production debug prevention, mutation replay sandboxing, force-release approval gates | pipeline, consensus, pipeline-debugger, mesh-coordination |
| **AST08** Poor Scanning | Critical/high severity findings locked to lossless compression, data classification-aware retention | context-compression |
| **AST09** No Governance | Chain-hashed audit trails with ed25519 signing, AES-256-GCM trace encryption, PII/secret auto-redaction, privacy impact assessments, k-anonymity for cross-repo fingerprints, consent management with cryptographic proof | mesh, knowledge, agent-replay, cross-repo, drift-detection, mesh-coordination |

### Key Security Patterns

**Permission Manifests (AST03)**: Every node type declares its required filesystem paths, tools, and network access. Anything not declared is denied by default.

**Tamper Detection (AST01)**: The mesh skill (`injection: always`) is force-injected into every agent. Its integrity is verified via SHA-256 hash manifest and ed25519 signatures on every load.

**Audit Trails (AST09)**: All mesh operations, conflict resolutions, knowledge graph mutations, and agent lifecycle events produce chain-hashed, append-only audit records with configurable retention.

**Execution Sandboxing (AST06)**: TestRunner and CustomAgent shell commands run inside container isolation with dropped capabilities, resource limits, and command allowlists. Production environments block debug mode by default.

**Data Protection (AST09)**: Agent replay traces are encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM). Secrets, API keys, and PII are auto-redacted before persistence. Cross-repo insights require privacy impact assessment and k-anonymity verification before sharing.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full security policy, vulnerability reporting process, and safe harbor provisions.
