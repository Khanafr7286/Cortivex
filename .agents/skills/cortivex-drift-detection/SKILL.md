# Cortivex Drift Detection

You have access to a drift detection system that identifies when a codebase has diverged from its intended or documented state. Drift occurs silently -- architecture erodes, configs reference dead modules, test coverage slides, dependencies fall behind, and documentation describes features that no longer exist. This skill detects all of it, scores the severity, and tells you exactly what changed and when.

## Overview

Drift detection works by establishing a baseline snapshot of the codebase's intended state, then comparing the current state against that baseline on every scan. The system tracks five drift categories independently, each with its own detection strategy and severity scoring.

The drift score is a composite 0-100 value where 0 means the codebase perfectly matches its baseline and 100 means catastrophic divergence across all categories. Scores above 60 indicate structural problems that will compound if left unaddressed.

## When to Use

- After a sprint or release cycle to measure how far the codebase has drifted from its documented architecture
- As a nightly scheduled scan integrated into the `nightly-review` pipeline
- Before onboarding new team members to verify that documentation matches reality
- After large refactors to confirm that configs, tests, and docs were updated to match
- When dependency update PRs have been deferred and you need to quantify the technical debt
- Before major releases to catch coverage regressions and stale documentation

## When NOT to Use

- During active development on a feature branch where drift is expected and temporary
- On brand-new projects with no established baseline (run `baseline` first)
- For real-time file watching during coding sessions (use linting and IDE tools instead)
- As a replacement for CI test suites -- drift detection complements CI, it does not replace it

## How It Works

### Drift Categories

**Architecture Drift** measures how far the actual code structure has diverged from architecture documentation. It parses architecture docs (README sections, ADRs, design docs) and cross-references them against the file tree, module boundaries, and import graphs. When docs describe a `services/` layer but all business logic has migrated into `controllers/`, architecture drift catches it.

**Config Drift** detects pipeline configurations, build configs, and CI/CD definitions that reference files, modules, environment variables, or scripts that no longer exist. A webpack config importing a deleted alias, a pipeline YAML referencing a removed node type, or a Makefile target calling a script that was renamed -- all are config drift.

**Coverage Drift** tracks test coverage against established baselines. Unlike a simple threshold check, coverage drift measures the delta from the baseline per-module. If `src/auth/` was at 92% coverage when the baseline was set and has dropped to 71%, that is a 21-point coverage drift even if the overall project coverage is still above the global threshold.

**Dependency Drift** compares installed package versions against lockfile specifications and declared version ranges. It also detects packages declared in the manifest but missing from the lockfile, packages in the lockfile but removed from the manifest, and major version gaps between declared ranges and latest available versions.

**Documentation Drift** identifies README files, API docs, and guides that describe features, endpoints, or configurations that no longer exist in the codebase, as well as new features, modules, or public APIs that have no documentation at all.

### Drift Scoring

Each category produces a score from 0 to 100:

```
category_score = (drift_items / total_items) * severity_weight * 100

where:
  drift_items     = number of items that have drifted from baseline
  total_items     = total items tracked in this category
  severity_weight = multiplier based on item severity (0.5 for low, 1.0 for medium, 2.0 for high)
```

The composite drift score is a weighted average:

```
composite = (arch * 0.25) + (config * 0.20) + (coverage * 0.20) + (deps * 0.15) + (docs * 0.20)
```

Architecture drift is weighted highest because it signals systemic structural decay. Dependency drift is weighted lowest because it is often intentional (pinning versions).

## Quick Reference

| Operation | MCP Tool | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Full scan | `cortivex_drift({ action: "scan", baseline_id: "latest" })` | Compare current state against baseline |
| Set baseline | `cortivex_drift({ action: "baseline", label: "v2.4" })` | Snapshot current state as the target |
| Compare baselines | `cortivex_drift({ action: "compare", from_baseline, to_baseline })` | Diff two baselines to see progression |
| Generate report | `cortivex_drift({ action: "report", scan_id })` | Produce markdown report with recommendations |
| Start watching | `cortivex_drift({ action: "watch", interval_hours: 24 })` | Schedule recurring drift scans with alerts |

## Best Practices

1. **Establish a baseline after every release.** Run `baseline` with a label matching your version tag. This gives you a clean reference point and makes drift reports meaningful.
2. **Integrate drift scans into nightly pipelines.** Daily scans catch drift early when it is cheap to fix. Weekly scans let small drifts compound into expensive problems.
3. **Act on scores above 40 immediately.** Drift is exponential -- a score of 40 today becomes 60 in weeks because drifted areas attract more changes that are also drifted.
4. **Use category-specific scans for targeted work.** After a refactor, scan only `architecture` and `config`. After a test sprint, scan only `coverage`. Full scans are for health checks.
5. **Track drift trends, not just snapshots.** A score of 30 that was 10 last month is more alarming than a stable score of 35. Use the `compare` action and report trend data.
6. **Update baselines intentionally, not to hide drift.** Re-baseline only when the new state is the intended state. Re-baselining to make the score look better without fixing drift defeats the purpose.
7. **Pair drift detection with fix pipelines.** When coverage drift is detected, feed the results into a TestGenerator pipeline. When documentation drift is found, feed it into a DocWriter pipeline.

## Reasoning Protocol

Before running a drift scan or acting on results, reason through:

1. **Is the baseline still valid?** If the project has undergone an intentional architectural change (monolith to microservices, framework migration), the old baseline may be obsolete. Re-baseline if the intended state has changed.
2. **Is this drift intentional or accidental?** Dependency version pins may be deliberate. A developer may have moved service classes into controllers as part of a planned refactor. Check git history and PR descriptions before flagging intentional changes as drift.
3. **Which category should I prioritize?** Architecture drift at 60 with coverage drift at 15 means focus on architecture. Do not spread effort evenly -- fix the highest-scoring category first.
4. **Is the trend getting worse or stabilizing?** A stable drift score means the team is maintaining the current state (even if drifted). A rising score means active decay. Rising scores need immediate attention; stable scores can be scheduled for later.
5. **Can I fix this drift with an automated pipeline?** Coverage drift can be addressed with TestGenerator. Documentation drift can be addressed with DocWriter. Config drift often requires manual review. Match the fix strategy to the drift type.
6. **Am I scanning too frequently or too rarely?** Daily scans suit active development. Weekly scans suit maintenance-mode projects. Scanning every hour wastes resources without adding value because drift accumulates over days, not minutes.

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Consequence | Correct Approach |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| Never establishing a baseline | Drift scans have nothing to compare against; all results are meaningless | Run `baseline` before the first scan and after every release |
| Re-baselining to hide drift | Resets the score to 0 without fixing underlying problems; drift reappears immediately | Only re-baseline when the new state is the genuine intended state |
| Scanning all categories when you only need one | Wastes compute and produces noise that obscures the category you care about | Specify only the categories relevant to your current task |
| Ignoring drift scores below 30 | Small drift compounds silently; by the time it reaches 50+ it requires significant effort to fix | Address drift when it first appears, especially in architecture and coverage |
| Running drift scans without acting on results | Creates alert fatigue and trains the team to ignore drift reports | Every scan should produce assigned action items or an explicit decision to defer |
| Using drift detection as a gate that blocks deploys | Creates pressure to re-baseline or suppress findings rather than fix them | Use drift as an advisory metric, not a hard gate; pair with trend tracking |
| Scanning feature branches against main baseline | Feature branches are expected to diverge; flagging them as drifted is noise | Only scan the default branch or release branches against baselines |

**WRONG:**
```yaml
# Re-baselining every night to keep score at zero
name: nightly-reset
nodes:
  - id: reset_baseline
    type: DriftDetector
    config:
      action: baseline              # This just hides drift every night
      label: "nightly-auto"

  - id: scan
    type: DriftDetector
    depends_on: [reset_baseline]
    config:
      action: scan
      baseline_id: latest           # Always compares against the baseline just created
```

**RIGHT:**
```yaml
# Scan against the release baseline, report trend
name: nightly-drift
nodes:
  - id: scan
    type: DriftDetector
    config:
      action: scan
      baseline_id: "v2.4-release"   # Stable baseline from last release
      categories: [architecture, config, coverage, dependencies, documentation]

  - id: report
    type: DriftDetector
    depends_on: [scan]
    config:
      action: report
      include_recommendations: true
      include_history: true          # Shows trend over time
```

## Grounding Rules

- **No baseline exists for this repo:** Run `baseline` first with a descriptive label. Without a baseline, drift detection cannot function. Do not attempt to scan without one.
- **Drift score is high but the team says it is fine:** Present the specific drift items with evidence. A high score backed by concrete examples (deleted endpoints still in docs, coverage drops with file paths) is harder to dismiss than a number alone. But respect the team's judgment -- if the drift is intentional, re-baseline.
- **Architecture docs do not exist:** Architecture drift detection requires something to compare against. If no architecture documentation exists, skip the architecture category and suggest creating documentation as a prerequisite.
- **Coverage data is unavailable:** Coverage drift requires a coverage report (lcov, istanbul, pytest-cov). If the project has no test coverage tooling, skip the coverage category and flag the absence of coverage tooling as a finding itself.
- **Drift score suddenly jumped after a normal change:** Investigate whether the baseline was corrupted or whether a build artifact changed the file tree. False positives from generated files (dist/, build/) should be resolved by adding those paths to `ignore_paths`, not by suppressing the score.

## Advanced Capabilities

### Automated Remediation Actions

When drift is detected, the system can execute targeted remediation actions to bring the codebase back toward its baseline. Remediation supports three modes: `preview` shows what would change without applying fixes, `apply` executes the remediation, and `rollback` reverts a previous remediation by its operation ID.

```json
{
  "tool": "cortivex_drift_remediate",
  "request": {
    "action": "apply",
    "repo": "/path/to/repo",
    "scan_id": "drift-8f2a",
    "category": "config",
    "item_ids": ["cfg-001", "cfg-003"],
    "mode": "preview",
    "dry_run": true
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "tool": "cortivex_drift_remediate",
  "response": {
    "operation_id": "rem-7b3f",
    "status": "preview_ready",
    "actions": [
      {
        "item_id": "cfg-001",
        "type": "remove_dead_reference",
        "file": ".cortivex/pipelines/legacy-scan.yaml",
        "line": 14,
        "description": "Remove reference to deleted LegacyParser node type",
        "patch": "- type: LegacyParser\n+ type: StandardParser"
      },
      {
        "item_id": "cfg-003",
        "type": "update_path",
        "file": "webpack.config.js",
        "line": 22,
        "description": "Update alias from removed src/old-utils to src/utils",
        "patch": "- '@old-utils': path.resolve('src/old-utils')\n+ '@utils': path.resolve('src/utils')"
      }
    ],
    "risk_level": "low",
    "reversible": true
  }
}
```

### Drift Scoring & Severity Classification

Scoring thresholds and severity classifications are configurable per project. Define weight overrides, category-specific thresholds, and custom severity bands to match your team's risk tolerance.

```yaml
drift_scoring:
  severity_bands:
    - name: healthy
      range: [0, 20]
      color: green
      action: none
    - name: moderate
      range: [21, 40]
      color: yellow
      action: notify
    - name: concerning
      range: [41, 60]
      color: orange
      action: alert
    - name: critical
      range: [61, 100]
      color: red
      action: block_release

  category_weights:
    architecture: 0.30
    config: 0.20
    coverage: 0.20
    dependencies: 0.10
    documentation: 0.20

  severity_multipliers:
    low: 0.5
    medium: 1.0
    high: 2.0
    critical: 3.0

  per_category_thresholds:
    coverage:
      alert_at: 35
      block_at: 55
    architecture:
      alert_at: 30
      block_at: 50
```

### Baseline Management & Snapshots

Baselines can be managed programmatically through the snapshot API. Each snapshot captures the full state of all tracked categories and supports tagging, retention policies, and diff operations between arbitrary points in time.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://cortivex.io/schemas/drift-baseline-snapshot.json",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "baseline_id": { "type": "string", "pattern": "^bl-[a-f0-9]{4,8}$" },
    "label": { "type": "string", "maxLength": 64 },
    "created_at": { "type": "string", "format": "date-time" },
    "retention": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "policy": { "enum": ["keep_forever", "rolling", "count_based"] },
        "max_age_days": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 1 },
        "max_count": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 1 }
      }
    },
    "tags": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } },
    "categories": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "architecture": { "$ref": "#/definitions/architecture_snapshot" },
        "config": { "$ref": "#/definitions/config_snapshot" },
        "coverage": { "$ref": "#/definitions/coverage_snapshot" },
        "dependencies": { "$ref": "#/definitions/dependency_snapshot" },
        "documentation": { "$ref": "#/definitions/documentation_snapshot" }
      }
    }
  },
  "required": ["baseline_id", "label", "created_at", "categories"]
}
```

### Trend Forecasting & Predictive Alerts

The forecasting system analyzes historical drift scores to project future values and alert before thresholds are breached. It uses linear regression over configurable time windows and can trigger preemptive notifications when a category is projected to cross a severity band boundary.

```json
{
  "tool": "cortivex_drift_forecast",
  "request": {
    "repo": "/path/to/repo",
    "categories": ["architecture", "coverage"],

### Custom Drift Rule Definitions

Define custom drift rules to detect project-specific patterns that the built-in categories do not cover. Custom rules specify a detection strategy, matching patterns, a severity level, and an optional remediation hint. Rules are evaluated during every scan alongside the built-in categories.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://cortivex.io/schemas/drift-custom-rules.json",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "rule_id": { "type": "string", "pattern": "^rule-[a-z0-9-]+$" },
    "name": { "type": "string", "maxLength": 128 },
    "description": { "type": "string" },
    "category": { "enum": ["architecture", "config", "coverage", "dependencies", "documentation", "custom"] },
    "severity": { "enum": ["low", "medium", "high", "critical"] },
    "detection": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "strategy": { "enum": ["file_pattern", "import_graph", "content_match", "metric_threshold"] },
        "pattern": { "type": "string" },
        "target_paths": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } },
        "baseline_key": { "type": "string" }
      },
      "required": ["strategy"]
    },
    "remediation_hint": { "type": "string" }
  },
  "required": ["rule_id", "name", "severity", "detection"]
}
```

An example rule definition that flags direct database imports outside the data access layer:

```typescript
const noDirectDbImports: DriftRule = {
  rule_id: "rule-no-direct-db-imports",
  name: "No direct database imports outside DAL",
  description: "Detects modules importing database drivers directly instead of using the data access layer",
  category: "architecture",
  severity: "high",
  detection: {
    strategy: "import_graph",
    pattern: "^(pg|mysql2|mongodb|prisma)$",
    target_paths: ["src/**/*.ts", "!src/dal/**/*.ts"],
    baseline_key: "direct_db_import_count",
  },
  remediation_hint: "Move database access through src/dal/ modules. Direct driver imports outside the DAL violate the architecture boundary.",
};
```
